Okay, compile and build the test C (just need to give include path to
stp and lib dir).  You probably want to build an intermediate .o
because compilation of it takes quite a while since it is so
large. I'm sure it can be trimmed down I just don't have time to do it
at the moment.

i.e.
g++ -c -o test.o test.c -I/home/ddunbar/include

and link

g++ -o test test.o -L/home/ddunbar/lib -lstp

now if I link this with the current stp and try to run it just
crashes. If I run it using forked stp queries it completes ok, but
runs much much slower. If I link it with the stp from 2007-11-01 then
it runs to completion in about 3s on my machine.
