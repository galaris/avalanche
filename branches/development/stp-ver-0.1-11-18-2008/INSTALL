1. To install STP perform the following steps on your Unix/GNU-Linux/MacOS X commandline:

./configure --with-prefix=$HOME (or another installation directory)
make
make install

2. To test the system after installation:

make regressall

NB:
* If you want to compile STP with the parser for the SMT-LIB format, use make -f Makefile.smt instead.
* If you want to compile a statically linked version of STP, run ./liblinks.sh after the configure script, and then compile adding STATIC=true to the make commands.
